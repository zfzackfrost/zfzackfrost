# Hello and welcome!

Feel free to take a look around. Everything here is free, open-sourced, and licensed for both personal and commercial
use (mostly under the [MIT license][mit]). 

## Who am I?
My name is Zachary Frost. I have been programming since the year
2007, when I was eight years old. Since then I have become a
polyglot, capable of quickly learning mostly any coding language,
or relearning ones I have forgotten on the fly.

## Current Focus
At the present, much of my time is being devoted to developing
a free and open source game engine using the [Rust][rust] language, called [Prismal Engine][prismal].
